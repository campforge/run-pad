# Results and runtime helpers

Every script is compiled against a small runtime library, `RunPad.Runtime`. It provides
`.Dump()`, `DumpContainer`, `DumpOptions` and the `Util` class. Its namespace is imported
automatically, so none of these need a `using`. The API follows LINQPad's names, so many
LINQPad scripts work without changes.

## The output tabs

Under the editor are three tabs:

- **Results** — console output and `.Dump()` blocks, in the order the script produces
  them. Text the script writes to `Console.Error`, compiler errors and unhandled
  exceptions are shown as errors. The status strip below reads *Success*, *Cancelled* or
  an error state when the run ends, with the elapsed time.
- **Debugger** — the debugger panels; see [Debugging](debugging.md).
- **IL** — the IL disassembly of the last successful compile, as read-only text.

The button with the panel icon in the toolbar shows or hides the output area.

## `.Dump()`

`.Dump()` renders any value in the Results tab and returns the same value, so you can put
it in the middle of an expression:

```csharp
var evens = Enumerable.Range(1, 10)
    .Where(n => n % 2 == 0)
    .Dump("Even numbers")      // renders the list ...
    .Sum();                    // ... and the chain continues
evens.Dump();
```

How values are shown:

- A collection of objects becomes a table with one column per public property or field.
  A collection of simple values becomes a two-column table (`#`, `Value`).
- Nested objects and collections become nested tables, expanded up to **3 levels** by
  default.
- Collections show at most **1000 rows** by default; the rest is summarized as
  "… N more".
- Strings are shown in quotes and very long strings are shortened. `null` is shown as
  `null`.
- Dictionaries, enums, dates, numbers and booleans have their own formatting.

Without a label, the heading is the source text of the dumped expression. For
`total.Dump()` the heading is `total`.

### Overloads

| Call | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `x.Dump()` | Heading is the expression text. |
| `x.Dump("label")` | Custom heading. |
| `x.Dump(5)` | Expands nested values 5 levels deep. No heading. |
| `x.Dump(5, 1)` | 5 levels deep; levels after the first start collapsed (click to expand). |
| `x.Dump("label", 5)` | Heading and depth. |
| `x.Dump(true)`, `x.Dump("label", true)` | Accepted for LINQPad compatibility; the result looks the same as without `true`. |
| `x.Dump(new DumpOptions { … })` | Full control, see below. |

### `DumpOptions` and `Util.DumpDefaults`

```csharp
people.Dump(new DumpOptions
{
    Description = "People",
    MaxDepth = 2,
    MaxRows = 50,
    MembersToExclude = "Password,InternalId",
});
```

| Property | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Description` | Heading text. |
| `MaxDepth` | Nesting levels to expand (default 3). |
| `CollapseTo` | Levels after this one start collapsed. |
| `MaxRows` | Maximum rows per collection (default 1000). |
| `MembersToInclude`, `MembersToExclude` | Comma-separated member names to show or hide. |
| `IncludePrivateMembers` | Also show non-public properties and fields. |
| `AlphabetizeMembers` | Sort columns by name. |
| `NoTotals` | Hide the row-count footer under tables. |
| `RepeatHeadersAt` | Repeat the header row every N rows. |
| `ForceExpansion` | Render expanded even for types that start collapsed by default. |
| `UseInvariantCultureForNumbers` | Format numbers with the invariant culture. |
| `FormatStrings` | Format strings for integers, real numbers, dates and times. |
| `ToDataGrid` | Accepted for LINQPad compatibility; currently has no visible effect. |

To change the defaults for the rest of a run, set properties on `Util.DumpDefaults`, for
example `Util.DumpDefaults.MaxDepth = 5;`.

A type can control which members `.Dump()` shows by implementing `ICustomMemberProvider`.

## Live-updating output

`DumpContainer` is a placeholder block. Dump it once, then change its content; the same
block updates in place instead of adding a new one.

```csharp
var status = new DumpContainer("Starting...");
status.Dump("Status");
status.Content = "Halfway there";       // replaces the content in place
status.AppendContent("Still working");  // adds to it
status.ClearContent();                  // empties it
```

`UpdateContent`, `AppendContent`, `ClearContent`, `Refresh`, `Style` (inline CSS for the
block) and `DumpDepth` are available.

`Util.ProgressBar` works the same way:

```csharp
var progress = new Util.ProgressBar(0, "Processing").Dump();
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    Thread.Sleep(200);
    progress.PercentComplete = i * 20;  // the same bar updates
}
progress.Caption = "Done";
```

[`live-output.rpad`](examples/live-output.rpad) combines both. In the
[command-line runner](cli.md), each update is printed again below the previous output
instead of replacing it.

## Interactive input

A script can ask for input in the Results area while it runs:

```csharp
var name = Util.ReadLine("Your name?");
var age = Util.ReadLine<int>("Your age?");
var secret = Util.GetPassword("Password?");   // typed text is masked on screen
$"{name} is {age}".Dump();
```

An input bar appears under the output tabs with the prompt. Type the answer and press
++enter++. The script waits until you answer. `ReadLine<T>` converts the answer with the
invariant culture and works for types such as `int`, `double`, `bool` and `DateTime`.
If the run is cancelled before you answer, the result is `null` (or the default value).

Interactive input works only in a normal run in the RunPad window. It is not available
while debugging, and the command-line runner does not answer input requests, so such a
script waits there until you press ++ctrl+c++.

## Other `Util` helpers

| Member | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Util.CurrentQueryPath` | Full path of the running `.rpad` file, or `null` for an unsaved tab. |
| `Util.Cache(func, key, duration)`, `Util.CacheAsync(…)` | Returns a cached result for `key`, or runs the function and stores its result. The cache survives across runs; `duration` is an optional time-to-live. |
| `Util.SaveString`, `Util.LoadString`, `Util.SaveBytes`, `Util.LoadBytes` | Save and load files by name in RunPad's per-user data folder. |
| `Util.Try(action)`, `Util.Try(func)` | Run code and get the exception back instead of having it thrown. |
| `Util.KeepRunning()` | Keeps the script's process alive until the returned object is disposed, for timers or background work. |
| `Util.Cmd(…)` | Runs an external program, streams its output into the Results tab and returns its exit code. An overload captures the output into a string instead. |

`Util.Cache` and the `Save…` methods write files under the `UserData` folder inside
RunPad's data folder (see [Where RunPad stores data](reference.md#where-runpad-stores-data)).
Cached entries stay there until they expire or you delete the files.
